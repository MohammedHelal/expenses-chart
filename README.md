## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [D3](https://d3js.org/) - D3 JS library

### What I learned

I got to practice using D3 library to draw a chart based on the information.

### Continued development

I still need to practice more to be able to use D3 without much issues since I needed to go back a few times and look at the documentation to be able to do it.

### Useful resources

- [D3 JS tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/d3js-tutorial-data-visualization-for-beginners/) - This helped me understand how to use D3.
